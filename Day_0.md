**Today's Progress**:

## Introduction to Python and Programming in general

We use computers on a daily basis to do various task such as watch movies, visit a website, edit photos, work on a spreadsheet etc. We are able to do these task using different individual programs that are designed to do a certain type of task(Newer programs are designed to do different types of task from the same program). 

### So what is a program ?

A program is basically a set of instructions. These instructions are also written using another program. The computer doesnt undertsand english, it only understands 0s and 1s. These instructions are called machine code or machine language. it someting like following 101001011100 etc...

### Are there different types of program ? 

However, writing machine language is very difficult and confusing so some people created a programs which takes human readable language like english and converts this into machine language. This is called a compiler which compiles the codes we give and converts it to 0s and 1s for the machine to understand. 

We humans write the program in simple english, which is called a high level language e.g python, c, Go, c++. Then its converted to machine code which is an low level language e.g Assembly

## ABCD of Python

To write any language we need to learn the alphabets to form words, then use words to form sentences and use correct grammer for our sentences to make sense. So if we want write instruction in the language of python then we need to learn the words of python. Luckily there are only a few words in the python vocabulary and using these words we can write amazing programs that do all sorts of things. 

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
